## Has this ever happened to you?
<img width="332" height="202" alt="An image of a description of a Joker in Balatro, but some of the text is cut off by the bottom of the screen." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae950d5b-7a30-470d-b766-7e94e99b2627" /><br/>
You want to play a Balatro mod, but the description of a card is too long to fit on your screen!<br/>
Well that's exactly what happened to me, and that prompted me to make a mod to fix it.<br/>
And after _a long time_, I finished it!<br/>
Now nobody should ever have to go through what I went through!<br/>
Just simply:<br/>
1. Download this mod via Code > Download ZIP<br/>
2. Install the mod into your Balatro Mods directory (`%AppData%/Roaming/Balatro/Mods` on Windows), making sure the file structure isn't nested<br/>
3. Launch Balatro<br/>
4. Use the arrow keys to move any description text around the screen, and use Home to return it to its original position<br/>
5. Congratulations!<br/><br/>
