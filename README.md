## Has this ever happened to you?
<img width="332" height="202" alt="An image of a description of a Joker in Balatro, but some of the text is cut off by the bottom of the screen." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae950d5b-7a30-470d-b766-7e94e99b2627" />  
You want to play a Balatro mod, but the description of a card is too long to fit on your screen!  
Well that's exactly what happened to me, and that prompted me to make a mod to fix it.  
And after _a long time_, I finished it!  
Now nobody should ever have to go through what I went through!  
Just simply:  
1. Download this mod via Code > Download ZIP  
2. Install the mod into your Balatro Mods directory (`%AppData%/Roaming/Balatro/Mods` on Windows), making sure the file structure isn't nested  
3. Launch Balatro  
4. Use the arrow keys to move any description text around the screen, and use Home to return it to its original position  
5. Congratulations!
